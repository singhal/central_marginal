'''
usage: python Summarize_Outputs.py [full path to directory with results files]

example: python Summarize_Outputs.py users/dan/moments_analyses/results/

The purpose of this script is to make sense of the results files
that are produced after optimizations have been run on multiple
models, as there will be an output file for every model included
that is filled with many replicates across several rounds.

Two summary files will be produced:
1. Results_Summary_Extended.txt
    This contains the top five replicates for each results file, with all the information
    including: "Model"	"Replicate"	"log-likelihood"	"AIC"	"chi-squared"	"theta"	"optimized_params"

2. Results_Summary_Short.txt
    This is essentially a simplified version of the above file, and only contains the
    top scoring replicate per model and it is already sorted in order of AIC.

You should probably inspect that the top-scoring replicates were ERROR-FREE. 
Often errors are logged on screen and log-likelihoods are still produced.
